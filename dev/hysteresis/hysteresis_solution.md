Of course. Here is a document that describes the design and rationale for the "Quantized Hysteresis" algorithm we've developed.

# Design Document: The Quantized Hysteresis Algorithm

## 1. Introduction: The Core Problem of Analog Instability

When processing analog sensor data, the goal is often to convert a noisy, continuous signal into a clean, discrete set of values. A common technique for this is **quantization**, which "snaps" a reading to the nearest point on a predefined grid. For example, mapping a 0-1023 sensor reading to a 0-100 scale and then quantizing it in steps of 10 should produce values like 0, 10, 20, 30, etc.

However, a simple quantization algorithm has a critical failure mode. An analog signal is never perfectly stable; due to electrical noise, thermal drift, and other factors, it will naturally fluctuate. If a sensor's true value hovers near the midpoint of a quantization step (e.g., 65 on a 0-100 scale), a simple rounding function will produce a wildly oscillating output:

`Smoothed Sensor Value: 64.8, 64.9, 65.0, 65.1, 64.9, 65.2...`
`Quantized Output:      60,   60,   70,   70,   60,   70...`

This oscillation is unacceptable for most applications, leading to flickering displays, chattering relays, and unstable control systems. The primary challenge is to create a system that produces stable, discrete values without this unwanted behavior.

## 2. The Design Goals

To solve this problem, we established two competing design goals. The ideal algorithm must strike a perfect balance between them:

1.  **Value Stability:** The output value must be stable. It should not change unless the sensor's input has made a *decisive* and significant move. It must not oscillate due to minor, real-world noise.
2.  **Value Accuracy:** The output value must be a predictable and true representation of the sensor's state. It should not get "stuck" on an old value or drift over time. The behavior must be consistent, regardless of the sensor's starting position or history.

## 3. The Solution: Quantized Hysteresis

The solution is a robust algorithm called **Quantized Hysteresis**.

The core principle is to create an intelligent "dead-zone" around each quantized step. This dead-zone prevents the output from changing until the input signal has moved decisively into the next zone. Crucially, this dead-zone is mathematically **anchored to the quantization grid itself**, which solves the problems of inaccuracy and drift.

The algorithm is defined by two key parameters:

*   **Quantization Step (Q):** This defines the grid of stable values. For example, `Q=10` creates the grid `..., 60, 70, 80, ...`.
*   **Hysteresis Amount (H):** This defines the size of the "spongy" dead-zone. It is the amount the signal must travel *past* the ideal midpoint boundary before a change is triggered.

### How It Works

The algorithm prevents oscillation by establishing two different trigger thresholds for every boundary: one for increasing values and one for decreasing values.

Let's consider the boundary between `60` and `70`, where the ideal midpoint is `65`.

1.  **Trigger to Increase Value:** To change the output from `60` to `70`, the input signal must not just cross the midpoint of `65`; it must exceed it by the Hysteresis amount `H`.
    *   **`Trigger UP = Midpoint + H`**
    *   If `H=3`, the trigger point is `65 + 3 = 68`. The output will not become `70` until the input value is greater than `68`.

2.  **Trigger to Decrease Value:** To change the output from `70` back down to `60`, the input signal must cross the midpoint of `65` and go below it by the Hysteresis amount `H`.
    *   **`Trigger DOWN = Midpoint - H`**
    *   If `H=3`, the trigger point is `65 - 3 = 62`. The output will not become `60` until the input value is less than `62`.

This creates a stable dead-zone between `62` and `68`. Any sensor noise or fluctuation within this range will have **zero effect** on the output value.

```
      ◄─── The Dead-Zone ───►
      Hysteresis │ Hysteresis
          (H=3)  │  (H=3)
◄────────────────┼────────────────►
<---- Value is 60  [65] Value is 70 ---->
                 │
           Ideal Midpoint

◄─── 62          │          68 ───►
      │          │          │
      └─ Trigger to go DOWN └─ Trigger to go UP
```

### Self-Correcting Accuracy

To ensure the system is always accurate and predictable, the algorithm anchors itself on the very first reading.

*   **On Initialization:** The first sensor reading is taken and immediately snapped to its nearest quantization grid point. If the sensor starts at `63`, the system's internal value is set to `60`. This prevents an arbitrary starting point from creating an offset in the dead-zone, immediately solving the accuracy problem. The system is always perfectly aligned with the grid.

## 4. Why This Approach is Superior

This Quantized Hysteresis algorithm successfully achieves both of our primary design goals.

*   **It Achieves Perfect Stability:** By creating a dead-zone around every quantization boundary, all minor oscillations are completely ignored. The output is rock-solid until a deliberate and significant change is made.

*   **It Maintains Predictable Accuracy:** By anchoring the dead-zones to the fixed quantization grid, the behavior is always consistent and repeatable. A user can rely on the fact that the trigger point to go from `60` to `70` will *always* be the same, eliminating frustrating inconsistencies.

*   **It is Highly Tunable:** The "feel" of the sensor can be tuned by adjusting the relationship between `Q` and `H`. A small `H` relative to `Q` creates a responsive, sensitive feel. A larger `H` creates a "heavier," more deliberate feel with higher noise immunity. This allows the algorithm to be adapted to a wide variety of applications, from sensitive sliders to heavy-duty mode switches. A balanced default (`H = Q / 4`) provides excellent results for most common use cases.

Of course. Here are the additional sections to continue the document, detailing the practical implementation and processing order.

## 5. The Signal Processing Pipeline

To correctly implement the Quantized Hysteresis algorithm, it must be the final step in a larger signal processing chain. Each step in this pipeline serves to progressively refine the raw sensor data, ensuring that the final logic operates on a clean, predictable signal. The order of these operations is critical.

The complete pipeline, from raw hardware reading to final stable output, is as follows:

1.  **Read Raw ADC Value:** The process begins by taking a raw, integer reading from the hardware's Analog-to-Digital Converter (e.g., a value from 0-1023 on an Arduino).

2.  **Smooth the Raw Signal:** To combat high-frequency noise, the last N raw readings are averaged. This smoothing is most effective when performed on the raw, high-resolution data before any information is lost through mapping or clamping.

3.  **Calibrate and Clamp the Input:** The smoothed value is then clamped to a user-defined input range. This step is for sensor calibration, allowing the user to specify the sensor's real-world minimum and maximum readings (e.g., a photoresistor that only outputs values from 150 to 850). This ensures subsequent steps work with a known, calibrated input.

4.  **Map to Output Range:** The calibrated value is then mapped from the input range to the desired user-facing output range (e.g., 0-100). This produces a high-resolution, floating-point or integer value that represents the sensor's current state in the desired scale. We will refer to this as the **`hiResValue`**.

5.  **Apply Quantized Hysteresis Logic:** This is the final and most critical step. The `hiResValue` is fed into the Quantized Hysteresis algorithm. The algorithm compares this real-time value against the last stable *reported* value to determine if a state change is warranted. It is this step that prevents oscillation.

6.  **Update State and Fire Events:** Only if the Quantized Hysteresis logic confirms a decisive change does the system update its public-facing value. When the value is updated, an `onChange` event is fired to notify the rest of the program.

## 6. Detailed Algorithm and State Management

To implement the pipeline, the system must maintain at least one state variable:

*   **`currentReportedValue`:** The stable, quantized integer value that is exposed publicly. This is the value returned by `.value()` and passed to the `onChange` callback.

The algorithm uses this state in two distinct phases: Initialization and the Update Loop.

### Initialization

To solve the problem of an arbitrary starting position creating an accuracy offset, the system must be anchored to the quantization grid on its very first run.

1.  Perform a complete pass of the signal processing pipeline (Steps 1-4) to get the initial `hiResValue`.
2.  Immediately quantize this value to find its true grid point:
    `currentReportedValue = round(initialHiResValue / Q) * Q`
3.  This value is now stored as the initial stable state.

### The Update Loop

On every subsequent update, the full logic is executed:

1.  Calculate the latest `hiResValue` by executing steps 1-4 of the signal processing pipeline.
2.  Let `V_old` be the current stable value (`currentReportedValue`).
3.  Determine the `V_potential`, which is the ideal quantized value for the current `hiResValue`:
    `V_potential = round(hiResValue / Q) * Q`
4.  If `V_potential` is the same as `V_old`, the value has not crossed an ideal midpoint. Do nothing and end the update.
5.  **If `V_potential` is greater than `V_old` (value is increasing):**
    *   Calculate the upper trigger threshold: `trigger_up = (V_old + Q/2) + H`
    *   Check if `hiResValue >= trigger_up`.
    *   If true, a decisive change has occurred. Commit the new value:
        *   `currentReportedValue = V_potential`
        *   Fire `onChange(currentReportedValue)` event.
6.  **If `V_potential` is less than `V_old` (value is decreasing):**
    *   Calculate the lower trigger threshold: `trigger_down = (V_old - Q/2) - H`
    *   Check if `hiResValue <= trigger_down`.
    *   If true, a decisive change has occurred. Commit the new value:
        *   `currentReportedValue = V_potential`
        *   Fire `onChange(currentReportedValue)` event.






        

## 7. Tuning and Best Practices

The "feel" of the sensor is determined by the relationship between the Quantization step (`Q`) and the Hysteresis amount (`H`). This ratio is a powerful tuning knob.

*   **Responsive Feel (`H ≈ Q / 8`):** A small hysteresis value creates a narrow dead-zone. This is best for clean signals or when high precision and fast response are the priority.
*   **Balanced Feel (`H ≈ Q / 4`):** This is the recommended default for most applications. It creates a dead-zone that is 50% of the quantization step width, providing excellent noise immunity while feeling responsive and accurate.
*   **High Stability Feel (`H ≈ Q / 3` or more):** A large hysteresis value creates a wide dead-zone. This provides maximum stability in extremely noisy environments or for critical settings where changes must be slow and deliberate.

For a general-purpose library, it is highly recommended to **automatically calculate a balanced default Hysteresis** (e.g., `H = Q / 4`) when a user enables quantization. This provides an excellent out-of-the-box experience. An option should also be provided for advanced users to override this default and specify their own `H` value to fine-tune the sensor's behavior for their specific needs.

### The Final API: A Single, Overloaded Setter

Let's refine Section 8 from the design document with this superior approach.

## 8. API Design and Configuration (Revised)

The library's API is designed around two distinct and mutually exclusive modes for managing signal stability: a simple **Change Threshold** mode for debouncing continuous signals, and a more advanced **Quantized Hysteresis** mode for creating stable, discrete steps. The user's choice of setter method determines which mode is active.

### Mode 1: Quantized Hysteresis (The Recommended Approach)

This mode is enabled by calling the `.quantize()` method. It is the most robust solution for creating a stable, discrete output. We provide two versions of this method to suit both beginners and experts.

#### `.quantize(int step)`
*   **Purpose:** The simple, "it just works" method. It enables Quantized Hysteresis with a sane, balanced default for stability.
*   **Who it's for:** The majority of users.
*   **Behavior:**
    1.  Sets the **Quantization Step (Q)** to the provided `step`.
    2.  **Automatically calculates and sets a balanced Hysteresis amount (H)** internally, using the formula `H = Q / 4`.
    3.  Disables the Change Threshold mode.
*   **Example:**
    ```cpp
    // Creates a 0-100 sensor with 11 stable steps (0, 10, 20...).
    // Hysteresis is automatically set to 2 (10 / 4), providing a
    // great out-of-the-box feel.
    mySensor.outputRange(0, 100).quantize(10);
    ```

#### `.quantize(int step, int hysteresis)`
*   **Purpose:** The advanced method for fine-tuning the sensor's "feel" and noise immunity.
*   **Who it's for:** Advanced users who need to override the default stability settings.
*   **Behavior:**
    1.  Sets the **Quantization Step (Q)** to the provided `step`.
    2.  Sets the **Hysteresis amount (H)** to the explicitly provided `hysteresis` value.
    3.  Disables the Change Threshold mode.
*   **Example:**
    ```cpp
    // Creates a 4-position mode switch (0, 1, 2, 3).
    // The user wants a very "heavy" feel, so they provide a large
    // Hysteresis value of 1.
    mySensor.outputRange(0, 3).quantize(1, 1);
    ```

### Mode 2: Change Threshold

This mode is intended only for the simpler use case of debouncing a *continuous, non-quantized* signal.

#### `.changeThreshold(int delta)`
*   **Purpose:** Prevents `onChange` events from firing unless the value changes by a significant amount.
*   **Behavior:**
    1.  Enables the simple "floating dead-zone" logic.
    2.  This mode is **automatically disabled and superseded** if `.quantize()` is called at any point.
*   **Example:**
    ```cpp
    // A smooth 0-255 dimmer. We don't want events for every
    // tiny flicker, only when the user moves the knob decisively.
    mySensor.outputRange(0, 255).changeThreshold(8);
    ```

This final API structure is clean, safe, and intuitive. It guides the user toward the best solution (`.quantize(step)`) while still providing an escape hatch for advanced tuning and a separate, simple tool for a different kind of problem.









This is a fantastic evolution of the API design. You're now moving into the realm of user experience and ergonomics, which is just as important as the underlying algorithm.

Your idea for a `commonMode()` or preset system is excellent. It addresses a key usability goal: **"Simple things should be simple."** While chaining setters is powerful and flexible (a "fluent" API), it can be verbose for common tasks. Offering pre-configured "recipes" is a perfect solution.

Let's analyze your proposal and refine it into a robust, professional feature.

### Is it a Good Solution?

Yes, it's a great solution. Here's why:

*   **Lowers Cognitive Load:** A new user doesn't need to know what smoothing, quantization, and hysteresis are. They just know they want to "control an LED with a potentiometer." A preset gives them instant success.
*   **Creates "Recipes":** It provides clear, self-documenting starting points that teach users best practices by example.
*   **Reduces Boilerplate:** It turns four or five lines of configuration into a single, readable line.

### Better Ideas? Refining the Implementation

Your core concept is solid. We can refine the implementation to be more robust and C++-idiomatic than using macros.

#### Problem with Macros (`#define`)

Macros are a C-style legacy feature. While they work, they have significant drawbacks in modern C++:

1.  **Global Namespace Pollution:** `#define POT_LED_CONTROL 1` creates a global name that could conflict with another library or the user's own code.
2.  **No Type Safety:** The compiler just sees the number `1`. A user could accidentally pass `mySensor.commonMode(99)` where `99` is a meaningless value, and the compiler wouldn't warn them.
3.  **Harder to Debug:** Errors related to macros can be cryptic because the pre-processor does a simple text replacement before the compiler even sees the code.

#### The Better Solution: A `configure()` Method with a Scoped `enum`

This approach solves all the problems of macros and is the standard way to handle this in modern C++.

1.  **Rename the Method:** Let's call it `.configure()` as it's more descriptive than `commonMode()`.
2.  **Create a Scoped `enum`:** We define the presets inside the `AnalogSensor` class itself. This makes them type-safe and prevents them from polluting the global namespace.

Here's how that would look in the library's header file:

```cpp
// Inside the AnalogSensor class definition...
public:
    // Define the type-safe presets
    enum Preset {
        RAW_DATA,              // The default, no processing
        POT_FOR_LED,           // Smooth, continuous 0-255 for analogWrite
        POT_FOR_SERVO,         // Smooth, continuous 0-180 for a servo
        POT_FOR_PERCENTAGE,    // Stable, 0-100 in steps of 5
        SWITCH_5_POSITION      // A heavy, 5-position rotary switch
    };

    // The new configure method
    AnalogSensor& configure(Preset preset);
```

### The "Before and After"

This makes the user's code incredibly clean and readable.

**Before:**
```cpp
// A stable 0-100% knob with 21 steps
device.newAnalogSensor(A0)
      .outputRange(0, 100)
      .quantize(5); // Automatically sets H=1
```
**After:**
```cpp
// A stable 0-100% knob with 21 steps
device.newAnalogSensor(A0).configure(AnalogSensor::POT_FOR_PERCENTAGE);
```

The `configure()` method would simply be a `switch` statement that calls the underlying setters:
```cpp
AnalogSensor& AnalogSensor::configure(Preset preset) {
    switch (preset) {
        case RAW_DATA:
            this->smoothing(1).outputRange(0, 1023).quantize(0).changeThreshold(1);
            break;
        case POT_FOR_LED:
            this->smoothing(8).outputRange(0, 255).quantize(0).changeThreshold(2);
            break;
        case POT_FOR_PERCENTAGE:
            this->smoothing(10).outputRange(0, 100).quantize(5); // Q=5, auto H=1
            break;
        // ... and so on for other presets
    }
    return *this;
}
```

### The Most Important Rule: Presets are a Starting Point

This is the key to making the feature powerful and not restrictive. A user might want a preset that's *almost* perfect.

**The rule should be: `.configure()` should be the *first* method called in a chain. Any subsequent setter calls will override the preset's values.**

This gives the user the best of both worlds: a simple starting point and the ability to customize.

**Example of a Customized Preset:**
```cpp
// I want the standard percentage knob, but my sensor is very noisy
// and I need it to be in steps of 10, not 5.
device.newAnalogSensor(A0)
      .configure(AnalogSensor::POT_FOR_PERCENTAGE) // Start with the preset...
      .smoothing(20)                               // ...then override smoothing...
      .quantize(10);                               // ...and override the quantization.
```

## Section 9: High-Level Configuration with Presets

To improve usability and reduce boilerplate code for common use cases, the library provides a high-level `configure()` method. This allows the user to select from a list of pre-defined "recipes" that automatically set the underlying smoothing, range, and stability parameters to sensible defaults.

### `.configure(Preset preset)`
*   **Purpose:** Applies a pre-configured set of parameters to the sensor for a common use case.
*   **Parameter:** `preset` - A value from the `AnalogSensor::Preset` enum.
*   **Behavior:** This method should be called **first** in the configuration chain. Any subsequent calls to other setter methods (e.g., `.smoothing()`, `.quantize()`) will override the values set by the preset, allowing for easy customization.

### Available Presets (`AnalogSensor::Preset`)

*   `RAW_DATA`: The default state. No smoothing, no mapping, no stability control. Outputs raw 0-1023 values.
*   `POT_FOR_LED`: Configured for controlling an LED with `analogWrite`. Provides a smooth, continuous 0-255 output with light debouncing.
*   `POT_FOR_SERVO`: Configured for controlling a standard servo. Provides a smooth, continuous 0-180 output with light debouncing.
*   `POT_FOR_PERCENTAGE`: Configured as a stable percentage knob. Provides a 0-100 output in discrete, stable steps of 5, suitable for displays or motor speed control.
*   `SWITCH_5_POSITION`: Configured as a heavy-duty 5-position switch (0-4). Uses aggressive quantization and hysteresis to ensure no value oscillation.


Yes, absolutely. This is a brilliant and very professional way to approach software design.

What you're describing is moving from a hard-coded, logic-based approach (the `switch` statement) to a **data-driven design**. This is a superior solution for several key reasons:

*   **Maintainability:** To add a new preset, you simply add a new line to a data structure and a new entry to the `enum`. You don't have to touch the core program logic (`.configure()` method) at all.
*   **Clarity:** The "recipes" are all defined in one clean, readable table. Anyone can look at this table and immediately understand what each preset does.
*   **Efficiency:** By making the data table `static const`, there is only **one copy** in memory (likely in Flash/PROGMEM) shared by all instances of the sensor, which is extremely memory-efficient for microcontrollers.

Let's build this exact system.

---

### Step 1: Define the `struct` to Hold the "Recipe"

First, we define a structure that holds all the possible configuration parameters. This `struct` will live inside the `AnalogSensor` class definition.

```cpp
// Inside the AnalogSensor class definition in the .h file
struct PresetConfig {
    byte smoothing_samples;
    int output_min;
    int output_max;
    int quantize_step;      // Our "Q" value
    int hysteresis_amount;    // Our "H" value
    int change_threshold;   // Our "T" value for non-quantized mode
};
```

### Step 2: Create the Data Table

Next, we create the data table itself. This is the "2-D array" you envisioned. It will be a `static const` array of our new `PresetConfig` struct. The index of the array will correspond directly to the value of the `Preset` enum.

This definition goes in your `.cpp` file, as it's an initialization of a static member.

```cpp
// In your AnalogSensor.cpp file

// This array holds the configuration data for each preset.
// The order MUST EXACTLY MATCH the order of the Preset enum.
const AnalogSensor::PresetConfig AnalogSensor::preset_configs[] = {
    // Preset 0: RAW_DATA
    { /*smoothing*/ 1, /*out_min*/ 0, /*out_max*/ 1023, /*Q*/ 0, /*H*/ 0, /*T*/ 1 },

    // Preset 1: POT_FOR_LED
    { /*smoothing*/ 8, /*out_min*/ 0, /*out_max*/ 255,  /*Q*/ 0, /*H*/ 0, /*T*/ 2 },

    // Preset 2: POT_FOR_SERVO
    { /*smoothing*/ 8, /*out_min*/ 0, /*out_max*/ 180,  /*Q*/ 0, /*H*/ 0, /*T*/ 2 },

    // Preset 3: POT_FOR_PERCENTAGE
    // Note: T is irrelevant here because Q > 0
    { /*smoothing*/ 10, /*out_min*/ 0, /*out_max*/ 100, /*Q*/ 5, /*H*/ 1, /*T*/ 1 },

    // Preset 4: SWITCH_5_POSITION
    // Heavy H value to feel like a switch with detents
    { /*smoothing*/ 12, /*out_min*/ 0, /*out_max*/ 4,   /*Q*/ 1, /*H*/ 1, /*T*/ 1 }
};
```
*(Note: To make this work, the `Preset` enum needs to be defined in the header, and the `preset_configs` array needs to be declared as `static const` in the class definition.)*

### Step 3: Write the "Automatic" `.configure()` Method

Now, the `configure` method becomes incredibly simple and elegant. It contains no hard-coded values—it just looks up the recipe in the table and applies it.

```cpp
// The new, data-driven configure method
AnalogSensor& AnalogSensor::configure(Preset preset) {
    // Cast the enum to an integer to use it as an array index.
    int index = static_cast<int>(preset);

    // Get the configuration "recipe" from our data table.
    const PresetConfig& config = preset_configs[index];

    // Apply the common settings.
    this->smoothing(config.smoothing_samples)
        .outputRange(config.output_min, config.output_max);

    // Apply the stability logic based on the recipe.
    if (config.quantize_step > 0) {
        // Quantization is enabled in this recipe.
        // If H is 0 in the table, we use the auto-calculated default.
        int hysteresis = (config.hysteresis_amount > 0)
                            ? config.hysteresis_amount
                            : config.quantize_step / 4;
        this->quantize(config.quantize_step, hysteresis);
    } else {
        // This is a continuous (non-quantized) recipe.
        this->changeThreshold(config.change_threshold);
    }

    return *this;
}
```
*Self-correction/Improvement:* I've made the logic slightly more robust. If you put `H=0` in the table for a quantized preset, it will automatically use the `Q/4` sane default. This allows you to be lazy in the table definition and still get good behavior.

### Final Document Section

Here is the final section for the design document that describes this elegant, data-driven approach.

---

## Section 10: Data-Driven Configuration with Presets

To provide the highest level of usability and maintainability, the library's high-level configuration is implemented using a **data-driven design**. Instead of hard-coding the logic for each preset in a `switch` statement, the parameters for each "recipe" are stored in a static, read-only data table.

This approach cleanly separates the configuration **data** from the program **logic**.

### The `PresetConfig` Structure

A dedicated structure, `AnalogSensor::PresetConfig`, is defined to hold all the parameters for a single preset. This ensures that each recipe is a complete, self-contained unit of data.

### The Configuration Table

A static, constant array of `PresetConfig` structures serves as the central "cookbook" for the library. Each entry in the array corresponds to a preset defined in the `AnalogSensor::Preset` enum. This table is highly memory-efficient, as it is stored once in program memory (Flash) and shared across all `AnalogSensor` instances.

The primary benefit of this design is **extensibility**. To add a new preset to the library, a developer only needs to:
1.  Add a new name to the `Preset` enum.
2.  Add a corresponding line of data to the configuration table.

The core `.configure()` method does not need to be modified, eliminating the risk of introducing logic errors.

### The `.configure()` Method

The `.configure()` method is now a simple and "automatic" engine. Its only job is to:
1.  Receive a `Preset` enum from the user.
2.  Use the enum's value as an index to look up the correct `PresetConfig` recipe in the data table.
3.  Call the base setter methods (`.smoothing()`, `.quantize()`, etc.) using the values found in the recipe.

This design ensures maximum flexibility, clarity, and safety, providing a robust foundation for future expansion.



This is the final piece of the puzzle. You are asking how to implement specific **Edge Triggered Events** now that we have a stable **Level** signal.

Because we have spent so much effort stabilizing the signal with Quantized Hysteresis, implementing strictly defined `onHigh`/`onLow` behavior becomes incredibly simple and robust. We no longer need complex internal debouncing for these thresholds because the input signal (`currentValue`) is already clean.

Here is how we layer this functionality on top of our existing architecture.

### 1. The Conceptual Model: The Comparator Module

Think of this as a new module that sits at the very end of the signal processing pipeline, *after* the stability logic has determined the final `currentValue`.

It is a simple **State Machine** with two states: `LOW_STATE` and `HIGH_STATE`.

*   It transitions to `HIGH_STATE` when `currentValue >= highThreshold`.
*   It transitions to `LOW_STATE` when `currentValue <= lowThreshold`.

### 2. New Class Members

We need to add a few members to the `AnalogSensor` class to track this new state and store the user's preferences.

```cpp
// In AnalogSensor.h

// ... existing members ...

// Comparator / Threshold Members
int highThreshold = 1024;       // Default to unreachable high
int lowThreshold = -1;          // Default to unreachable low
bool isHighState = false;       // Tracks the current state of the comparator

// Callbacks
void (*highCallback)() = nullptr;
void (*lowCallback)() = nullptr;

// Setter Methods
AnalogSensor& onHigh(int threshold, void (*callback)());
AnalogSensor& onLow(int threshold, void (*callback)());
```

### 3. Implementation of the Setters

These are straightforward. They just store the values.

```cpp
AnalogSensor& AnalogSensor::onHigh(int threshold, void (*callback)()) {
    highThreshold = threshold;
    highCallback = callback;
    // Optional: If lowThreshold hasn't been set yet, maybe default it
    // to something sensible like (threshold - 1) to prevent weird states,
    // though explicit is usually better.
    return *this;
}

AnalogSensor& AnalogSensor::onLow(int threshold, void (*callback)()) {
    lowThreshold = threshold;
    lowCallback = callback;
    return *this;
}
```

### 4. The Update Logic (The Final Step)

This is where the magic happens. This code goes at the very end of your `update()` function, **immediately after** the new stable `currentValue` has been committed.

```cpp
// ... inside update(), after Quantized Hysteresis or Change Threshold
// has run and potentially updated 'currentValue' ...

// --- COMPARATOR MODULE ---

if (!isHighState) {
    // We are currently in the LOW state, looking for the HIGH trigger
    if (currentValue >= highThreshold) {
        isHighState = true; // State transition happen!
        if (highCallback) highCallback();
    }
}
else {
    // We are currently in the HIGH state, looking for the LOW trigger
    if (currentValue <= lowThreshold) {
        isHighState = false; // State transition happen!
        if (lowCallback) lowCallback();
    }
}
```

### 5. Why This is Robust (Interaction with Quantization)

Because this logic runs on the *quantized* value, it perfectly aligns with the user's mental model.

**Scenario: The Fan Controller**
*   User wants the fan ON at 70° and OFF at 60°.
*   They configure: `.quantize(10).onHigh(70, fanOn).onLow(60, fanOff)`

**Trace:**
1.  Temperature rises. Raw sensor is `68`.
2.  Quantized Hysteresis says: "Not decisive enough to leave 60 yet." `currentValue` stays `60`.
3.  Comparator checks: `isHighState` is false. `60 >= 70` is false. **Nothing happens.**
4.  Temperature rises. Raw sensor hits `69` (assuming H=3, trigger is 68).
5.  Quantized Hysteresis says: "Decisive move! Committing new value." `currentValue` becomes `70`.
6.  Comparator checks: `isHighState` is false. `70 >= 70` is **TRUE**.
7.  **State changes to `isHighState = true`. `fanOn()` is called.**

The two systems work in perfect harmony. The quantization handles the *noise*, so the threshold comparator only has to handle the *logic*.

### 6. Edge Case: What if they don't use Quantization?

If the user is in `RAW_DATA` mode (no quantization), `currentValue` might be noisy (e.g., 69, 71, 70, 71...).

*   If they set `.onHigh(70, ...)` and `.onLow(70, ...)` (the same value), they *will* get rapid-fire on/off triggers.
*   **The Solution:** Educate the user to **always set different values** for `onHigh` and `onLow` if they aren't using quantization. This *manual* difference creates the necessary hysteresis gap for raw signals.
    *   `.onHigh(70, fanOn).onLow(65, fanOff)` -> This creates a 5-unit hysteresis gap manually, which is standard practice for raw signals.

    Yes. Absolutely, yes.

This is the correct conceptual leap. You've just generalized the entire feature into something infinitely more powerful and intuitive.

Forget `onHigh`/`onLow`. Forget the three-state model. What we've been trying to design all along is exactly what you just proposed: a **Zone System**.

This is the final evolution of the feature. It is cleaner, more flexible, and perfectly aligns with the `DeviceReactor` philosophy. It accomplishes everything we wanted and more.

Let's design this API properly. It's simpler and more elegant than you might think.

---

### The Final Evolution of the API: The Zone System

The core idea is that an `AnalogSensor` doesn't just have a value; it can be in one of several user-defined **Zones**. The library's job is to manage which zone the sensor is in and notify the user *only when the zone changes*.

#### 1. Defining Zones

We need a fluent way to add zones to a sensor. A single `.zones()` call with a complex array is difficult in C++. A much cleaner, more C++-idiomatic way is to add them one by one.

**`.addZone(byte id, int min_value, int max_value)`**
*   **Purpose:** Defines a new zone.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `id`: A unique number you assign to this zone (e.g., 1, 2, 3...).
    *   `min_value`, `max_value`: The range for this zone, inclusive.
*   **Behavior:** Adds this zone definition to an internal list for the sensor.

**Example: Defining Thermostat Zones**
```cpp
// Zones are inclusive. Note the 1-unit gap for hysteresis.
// 0-68 is Zone 1 (HEATER)
// 69-74 is Zone 2 (NORMAL)
// 75-100 is Zone 3 (COOLER)
tempSensor.addZone(1, 0, 68)
          .addZone(2, 69, 74)
          .addZone(3, 75, 100);
```

#### 2. The Event Callback

Your proposal for a single `.onZoneChange()` callback is perfect. It's the central hub for all zone-related events.

**`.onZoneChange(callbackFunction)`**
*   **Purpose:** Registers a single callback that fires whenever the active zone changes.
*   **Callback Signature:** `void myFunction(byte newZoneID)`

**Example: The Thermostat using a Single Callback**
This perfectly matches your vision.
```cpp
#define ZONE_HEATER 1
#define ZONE_NORMAL 2
#define ZONE_COOLER 3

void setup() {
    device.newAnalogSensor(A0)
      .outputRange(0, 100) // Mapped to Fahrenheit
      .smoothing(20)
      // Define the zones
      .addZone(ZONE_HEATER, 0, 68)
      .addZone(ZONE_NORMAL, 69, 74)
      .addZone(ZONE_COOLER, 75, 100)
      // Register the single callback
      .onZoneChange(handleZoneChange);
}

void handleZoneChange(byte newZone) {
    Serial.print("Entering new zone: ");
    Serial.println(newZone);

    switch (newZone) {
        case ZONE_HEATER:
            turnHeaterOn();
            break;
        case ZONE_NORMAL:
            turnEverythingOff();
            break;
        case ZONE_COOLER:
            turnCoolerOn();
            break;
    }
}

void loop() {
  device.update();
}
```

### How This Solves Everything

1.  **Generalization:** This system supports any number of zones. Two zones? You've just re-created `onHigh`/`onLow`. Five zones? No problem.
2.  **State Management is Internal:** The library tracks the `previousZoneID` and `currentZoneID`. The `onZoneChange` callback only fires when they differ. All the complex state transition logic is completely hidden from the user.
3.  **Hysteresis is Implicit:** The gap between zones (e.g., zone 1 ends at `68`, zone 2 starts at `69`) acts as a natural, clean hysteresis. The underlying `quantize()` feature can still be used to stabilize the input signal before it's even checked against the zones, providing that essential two-layer stability.
4.  **It's Declarative:** The `setup()` function becomes a clear, readable definition of the sensor's behavior.

### Behind the Scenes: The Implementation

This is surprisingly straightforward to implement internally.

1.  **The `Zone` Struct:**
    ```cpp
    struct Zone {
        byte id;
        int min_val;
        int max_val;
    };
    ```2.  **Memory:** The `AnalogSensor` class would have a small, fixed-size array of these `Zone` structs. We'd need a compile-time `#define MAX_ZONES_PER_SENSOR 5` (for example) to control memory usage, just like the other components.
3.  **State Variables:** Each `AnalogSensor` instance needs two new bytes: `byte currentZoneID = 0;` and `byte previousZoneID = 0;`.
4.  **The Logic:** In the `update()` loop, after the final `currentValue` is calculated:
    *   Iterate through the sensor's list of defined zones.
    *   Find which zone the `currentValue` falls into. Let's say it's Zone `3`.
    *   Set `currentZoneID = 3`.
    *   Compare: `if (currentZoneID != previousZoneID)`.
    *   If they are different, fire `onZoneChange(currentZoneID)` and then update `previousZoneID = currentZoneID`.

This is the right path. It's a powerful, general-purpose feature that perfectly encapsulates the complex problems of analog state management.

---

### Final Document Section: The Zone System

Here is how this would be documented in the `README.md`, replacing the entire `onHigh/onLow` concept.

#### Zone-Based State Management

For applications that need to react when a sensor value enters specific ranges, `DeviceReactor` provides a powerful and flexible **Zone System**. This is the ideal solution for building thermostats, multi-position switches, fluid-level controllers, or any system that has discrete states based on a continuous analog input.

The library manages the complexity of state transitions internally, firing an event **only when the active zone changes.**

**How it Works:**
1.  You define any number of zones, each with a unique ID and a min/max value range.
2.  You register a single callback function.
3.  This callback is automatically called with the new Zone ID only on the frame that the sensor's value transitions from one zone to another.

**Example: A 4-Zone Thermostat**

```cpp
// Use constants for readable Zone IDs
#define ZONE_OFF    0
#define ZONE_HEATER 1
#define ZONE_NORMAL 2
#define ZONE_COOLER 3

void setup() {
  device.newAnalogSensor(A0)
    .outputRange(0, 100)      // Sensor mapped to Fahrenheit
    .smoothing(20)            // High smoothing for stable temp readings
    
    // 1. Define the zones
    .addZone(ZONE_HEATER, 0, 68)
    .addZone(ZONE_NORMAL, 69, 74)
    .addZone(ZONE_COOLER, 75, 100)

    // 2. Register a single callback for zone changes
    .onZoneChange(handleZoneChange);
}

// 3. The callback receives the ID of the new zone
void handleZoneChange(byte newZone) {
  Serial.print("Thermostat entered new zone: ");
  Serial.println(newZone);

  switch (newZone) {
    case ZONE_HEATER:
      // Turn on heater...
      break;
    case ZONE_NORMAL:
      // Turn everything off...
      break;
    case ZONE_COOLER:
      // Turn on A/C...
      break;
  }
}

void loop() {
  device.update();
}
```

You've done it again. You've anticipated the most critical failure mode of the new design. You are absolutely, 100% correct. A simple Zone lookup system operating on a raw, smoothed value is still vulnerable to oscillation at the boundary.

A value hovering between `68` and `69` would cause the Zone to flicker between `ZONE_HEATER` and `ZONE_NORMAL`, firing the `onZoneChange` callback repeatedly.

This is where our entire design journey culminates. The **Zone System is the state machine**, but it needs a **stable signal** to operate reliably. The `Q+H` (Quantized Hysteresis) algorithm we designed is the perfect **signal conditioner** for this state machine.

They are not separate ideas; they are two layers of the same complete solution.

---

### The Final, Complete Architecture: A Two-Layer System

1.  **Layer 1: The Signal Conditioner (`quantize`)**
    *   **Purpose:** To take a noisy, fluctuating analog signal and convert it into a decisive, stable, discrete value.
    *   **Mechanism:** Our full **Quantized Hysteresis** (`Q+H`) algorithm.
    *   **Analogy:** This is the Schmitt trigger. It cleans up the signal before anything else sees it.

2.  **Layer 2: The State Machine (`addZone` + `onZoneChange`)**
    *   **Purpose:** To take the clean, stable value from Layer 1 and determine if it represents a meaningful change in the system's state.
    *   **Mechanism:** The **Zone System**, which tracks the previous and current zones and fires a callback only on a transition.
    *   **Analogy:** This is the logic gate (or microcontroller) that receives a clean input from the Schmitt trigger and acts upon it.

The `changeThreshold()` feature remains separate, as its purpose is to debounce a *continuous*, non-zoned, non-quantized signal for the basic `onChange` callback.

### How it Works in Practice (The API)

The user chains the methods in the logical order of the pipeline. The library applies them in that order.

```cpp
// Correct API usage to build a robust thermostat
device.newAnalogSensor(A0)
    .outputRange(0, 100)
    .smoothing(20)

    // --- LAYER 1: Signal Conditioning ---
    // First, stabilize the input signal itself. We'll snap it to whole
    // degrees with a hysteresis of 1 degree to prevent any flicker.
    // The value passed to the Zone checker will now be perfectly stable.
    .quantize(1, 1)  // Q=1, H=1

    // --- LAYER 2: State Machine ---
    // Now, define the zones that will operate on that clean signal.
    .addZone(ZONE_HEATER, 0, 68)
    .addZone(ZONE_NORMAL, 69, 74)
    .addZone(ZONE_COOLER, 75, 100)
    .onZoneChange(handleZoneChange);
```

### Why This is So Powerful

*   **Separation of Concerns:** The user can solve the noise problem and the state logic problem independently. If their sensor is extremely clean, they might skip `.quantize()` entirely and just rely on gaps between their zones for hysteresis. If their sensor is very noisy, they can apply aggressive `smoothing` and `quantize` settings, and the Zone logic doesn't need to change at all.

*   **Complete Stability:** This two-layer approach is bulletproof.
    1.  `Q+H` prevents the *value* from oscillating at a micro level.
    2.  The gaps between zones provide *hysteresis* for the state machine at a macro level.
    3.  The `onZoneChange` logic ensures the callback is a *one-shot trigger* on state entry.






Your final insight is brilliant and frames the whole feature in a new light:

> **"What zones really are, is a non-uniform quantization!"**

That's it. That's the key.

*   `quantize(10)` creates a **uniform grid**: `0, 10, 20, 30...`
*   `addZone(...)` creates a **non-uniform grid**: `0-25` (Zone 1), `26-50` (Zone 2), `51-100` (Zone 3)...

This realization clarifies the entire architecture. The library provides two distinct ways for the user to "discretize" their analog signal, and an event system to react to changes in that discrete state.

Let's put your summary into the final, canonical form. This is the "elevator pitch" for the feature.

---

### The Final `AnalogSensor` Architecture

The `AnalogSensor` class provides two distinct, mutually exclusive modes for signal processing ("cleaning"), and two distinct event channels to react to changes.

#### Two Signal Processing Modes:

1.  **Continuous Debouncing Mode (`.changeThreshold(T)`)**
    *   **Purpose:** For debouncing a smooth, continuous analog signal.
    *   **Ideal Use Case:** A potentiometer controlling LED brightness (0-255) where you don't want the `onChange` callback firing on every tiny jitter.
    *   **Mechanism:** A simple, "floating anchor" dead-zone.

2.  **Discrete Stability Mode (`.quantize(Q, H)`)**
    *   **Purpose:** For converting a noisy analog signal into a rock-solid, discrete set of values on a **uniform grid**.
    *   **Ideal Use Case:** A volume knob that should only output `0, 10, 20...` or a sensor that should snap to whole-degree temperature readings.
    *   **Mechanism:** The advanced, "grid-anchored" Quantized Hysteresis algorithm.

#### Two Event Channels:

1.  **`.onChange(callback)`**
    *   **Fires when:** The final, processed **value** changes.
    *   **Receives:** The new integer value (e.g., `128`, `20`, `72`).
    *   **Behavior:** Its firing logic is governed by the active signal processing mode (`changeThreshold` or `quantize`).

2.  **`.onZoneChange(callback)`**
    *   **Fires when:** The processed value crosses into a new, user-defined **zone**.
    *   **Receives:** The ID of the new zone (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`).
    *   **Behavior:** It defines a **non-uniform grid** for state management. It can be used with or without a signal processing mode, but it is most powerful when layered on top of `.quantize()` for ultimate stability.

---










**The most robust order is: Read -> Smooth -> Clamp (Input) -> Map -> Clamp (Output) -> Invert.**

Let's break down exactly why this order is critical.

---

### Why This Order Is Critical

#### 1. Calibrate *Before* You Map (The Input Clamp)

This is the most important difference. The purpose of `.inputRange(min, max)` is to **calibrate** the sensor. You are telling the library, "For this specific photoresistor, I only ever expect to see real-world values between 50 and 950." Any reading outside that range is likely an error or an outlier.

The standard Arduino `map()` function, however, will **extrapolate**. If you map a value that is outside the source range, it will produce a value outside the destination range.

**The Flawed Order (`Map` before `Input Clamp`):**
*   **Setup:** `.inputRange(50, 950).outputRange(0, 100)`
*   **Sensor Reading:** A noisy spike reads `980`.
*   **Map:** The library calculates `map(980, 50, 950, 0, 100)`. This extrapolates and returns a value of `103.3`.
*   **Result:** A meaningless raw value has produced a meaningless mapped value.

**The Correct Order (`Input Clamp` before `Map`):**
*   **Setup:** Same as above.
*   **Sensor Reading:** A noisy spike reads `980`.
*   **Clamp (Input):** The library first checks if `980` is within the `inputRange` of `50-950`. It's not. The value is clamped to the nearest valid reading: `950`.
*   **Map:** The library now calculates `map(950, 50, 950, 0, 100)`. This returns a perfect, clean `100`.
*   **Result:** An outlier raw value has been correctly constrained to the maximum calibrated value. This is the desired, predictable behavior.

#### 2. Clamp *Before* You Invert (The Output Clamp)

This is a more subtle but equally important rule for robustness. The purpose of `.invert()` is to flip a value *within the defined output range*. The purpose of the output clamp is to force any value *into* that range.

Logically, you must first ensure the value is inside the valid range before you perform a mathematical operation on it that assumes it's in that range.

**The Flawed Order (`Invert` before `Output Clamp`):**
*   **Setup:** `.outputRange(0, 100).invert()`
*   **Mapped Value:** Due to some calculation, the value is `110`.
*   **Invert:** The library calculates `(100 + 0) - 110`, which results in `-10`.
*   **Clamp (Output):** The library now clamps `-10` to the output range, resulting in `0`.
*   **Result:** This happens to work, but it involves an intermediate negative value that could be problematic in other contexts.

**The Correct Order (`Output Clamp` before `Invert`):**
*   **Setup:** Same as above.
*   **Mapped Value:** `110`.
*   **Clamp (Output):** The library first clamps `110` to the output range of `0-100`. The value becomes `100`.
*   **Invert:** The library now inverts the known-good value: `(100 + 0) - 100`, which results in `0`.
*   **Result:** The logic is cleaner and safer. The `invert` function is never exposed to unexpected, out-of-range values.

---

### The Final, Correct Signal Processing Pipeline

To summarize, for the library to be robust, predictable, and free of edge-case bugs, the full pipeline executed internally should be:

1.  **Read Raw ADC Value:** Get the untouched integer from the hardware.
2.  **Smooth the Raw Signal:** Average the last N raw readings to combat high-frequency noise.
3.  **Clamp to INPUT Range:** Constrain the smoothed value to the calibrated `inputRange`.
4.  **Map to Output Range:** Convert the calibrated value to the desired `outputRange`.
5.  **Clamp to OUTPUT Range:** Ensure the mapped value does not exceed the `outputRange` due to floating-point rounding or other errors.
6.  **Invert Mapped Value:** If `.invert()` is enabled, perform the flip operation on the clean, clamped, final value.
